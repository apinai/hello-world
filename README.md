# hello-world

I am 33 years-old. I am a little bit stupid, that says, people. I don't like world's order. Our presidents are very dumb. This is a message for aliens, I hope they will read this. We died because of Americans. I am tired to explain to people what the hell is going on this planet. This was my first sentence, that I wrote correctly. In English. Do not repeat this at home. If you want to be happy do not learn linguistics.
